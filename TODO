Packet Capture File Analysis
----------------------------


1- Pcap building
	Instead of Writing a full client/server to establish a pcap file. Narith can
	build a pcap file.
	To be considered:
	A- Protocols used 
	B- Data used
	C- Packet sequence can be multiplied from an expression or randomized

2- Pcap Inspection and Extraction
	Inspect a pcap file to extract certain exchanged data.
	A- Passwords
	B- Files & Files categorizer (e.g. images/html/exe/elf..etc)
	C- Domains -- DONE --
	D- Exchanged Data
	E- Sessions info -- DONE --
	F- Messages
	
------------------

Components:
Basic:
        1- Arguments, pcap files and external resources reader
        2- Ethernet/IP/TCP/HTTP/FTP..etc Data extractor and analyzer
Detailed:
        1- I/O Manager
        2- Categorizer
        3- Command Matching and Inspection
        4- Sessions Info
        5- Session Details
        6- Encrypted Sessions
======================

Advanced functionalities:
- Detecting Transport layer security
- Exchanged Emails and possible malicious mails occurrences.
- Cryptographic Risks and IP Security and Possible intrusion.
- Honeypots profiling and Levels of interactions.
- The List goes on.....


--------------------
User interaction:

GUI:
	Building GUI with tab for each module and tabular layout
	interfaces similar to interpreter module interfaces can
	be used

Statistics:
	Statistics and infographics to be build out of obtained
	information.

Visualization:
	Automatically render media objects such as images,audio and video

--------------------
Security wise:

Spoofing:
	Extract any anomalies and inspect malicious behaviour.

Files:
	Inspect received files and identify any malicious file (malwares)

Botnet:
	Inspect sent & received data and identify connection nature by
	stored Botnet connection patterns
